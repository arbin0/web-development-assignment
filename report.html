<h1> Conclusion</h1>
<p>This is the overall report of the webpages created. Idea to create this website was taken from other many websites. The header and footer are available fix at hop and bottom at every page for the ease of navigation. The website is user friendly and has pleasent visual effects. It is simple in design so the user have no dificulty in accessing the web pages. This site is responsive so it works </p>  
<p>This web page has certain limitations. When zoomed out the page looks rather untidy. It also deosn't contain any javascript which makes the site including only few limited features. So, if I get time to start over again I would certainly eradicate these problems and design a better website than this.</p><br><br><br><br>
